Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates fundamental data visualization techniques using Python. It covers the creation of several common plot types to explore and understand datasets, focusing on both the relationships between variables and the distribution of data points.

The project uses:

Python for data manipulation and plotting

Matplotlib for line and scatter plots

Seaborn for histograms, box plots, and enhanced visualizations

Pandas and NumPy for data handling and analysis

The dataset used is the Seaborn "tips" dataset, which contains information about restaurant bills, tips, and party sizes. This dataset allows for meaningful visualizations that illustrate trends, correlations, and data distributions.

📈 Visualizations Created

Line Plot – Shows the average total bill for each table size, illustrating how spending tends to increase with group size.

Scatter Plot – Demonstrates the relationship between total bill and tip, showing the correlation between the two variables.

Histogram – Displays the distribution of total bills, highlighting common ranges and frequency of values.

Box Plot – Summarizes the total bill distribution, showing median, quartiles, and outliers.

These visualizations provide both a statistical and graphical overview of the data, helping to identify patterns and anomalies.

🛠 Tools Used

Python – Core programming language for analysis and plotting

Matplotlib – Basic plotting library for line and scatter plots

Seaborn – High-level plotting library for statistical visualization

Pandas – Data manipulation and aggregation

NumPy – Numerical computations

▶ How to Run

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Open the Python script (data_visualization_project.py) in any IDE or text editor.

Run the script; all visualizations will be generated automatically.

Output images were captured via screenshots and included for reference.

📝 Notes on Presentation

Although no live screen recording was made, the screenshots clearly demonstrate the results of running the script. The key points illustrated by each plot are:

Line Plot – Trends in total bill relative to table size

Scatter Plot – Correlation between bill and tip amounts

Histogram – Distribution of total bills across all entries

Box Plot – Spread and outliers within total bills

These insights show how simple visualizations can be used to analyze and communicate data effectively.
